        Evan Allen Landry was a passionate golfer. 
        He played countless rounds of golf at Hunter Memorial Golf Course, where enjoying the outdoors and friendship of his fellow golfers was as important as the game. 
        Tragically, Evan's life was cut short by schizophrenia, which was diagnosed in his mid-twenties. 
        The Evan Allen Landry Golf Tournament has been created to honor Evan's life and to raise awareness of severe mental illness, which affects 6% of the population and is too often fatal. 
        Tournament proceeds will be used to fund the Evan Allen Landry Memorial Scholarship.
